# CCAligner-gui

This is a QT GUI frontend for [CCAligner](https://github.com/saurabhshri/CCAligner). It allows you to configure the options of CCAligner intuitively. *The project is in a very early stage and lacks many features which will be added later.*

# Development

To develop or to compile the project just open the `ccaligner-gui/ccaligner-gui.pro` project in [Qt Creator](https://www.qt.io/download). You will also have to have cmake installed.

# Running

To run CCAligner-gui you will need to place the `ccaligner` on your `PATH` or in the same directory as `ccaligner-gui`. Alternatively you can use the `CCALIGNER_PATH` envronment variable to point to a custom installation.
